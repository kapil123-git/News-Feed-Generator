Terraria arrives on Google Stadia, despite developer ultimatum
Terraria arrives on Google Stadia, the game streaming service. This is a surprise, as earlier this year, the co-creator of the game called out Google, claiming he had been banned from his Google account and lost years of valuable info and data. Despite his claim that Terraria would not launch on Stadia, it has arrived nonetheless.
